# luma-tracker

Goal:

In the online game "Temtem", the player can meet rare variations of creatures that are shiny and have a different colour.
This is called a "luma". The chance for these to appear is 1/6000. This tracker helps to keep track of the amount of Temtem you encounter, until you find a luma.

Todo:

1. Make buttons bigger
2. Work on Styling for Footer, Header
3. Make header and footer smaller, to fit on a mobile screen.
4. Actually test it for mobile
